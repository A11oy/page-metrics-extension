# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Performance Recommendations feature extends the existing Chrome extension to provide actionable performance optimization suggestions based on analysis of the initial full page load. After a webpage completes loading, users can generate comprehensive recommendations covering caching strategies, LCP optimization, script management, link tag optimization, and CSS analysis. The recommendations are presented in a structured JSON format that can be copied to the clipboard for further analysis or reporting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to generate performance recommendations after a page loads, so that I can identify specific optimization opportunities for the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits a webpage and it completes the initial full page load THEN the system SHALL enable the performance recommendations button
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Generate Recommendations" button THEN the system SHALL analyze the page and generate recommendations in JSON format
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display the recommendations and enable copying to clipboard
4. IF the page is still loading or analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading state on the button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance auditor, I want to analyze browser and CDN caching for the HTML document, so that I can identify caching optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing cache headers THEN the system SHALL inspect Cache-Control and Expires headers for browser caching
2. IF Cache-Control or Expires headers are present THEN the system SHALL extract and display the TTL value
3. IF no caching headers are found THEN the system SHALL mark as "No browser-side caching detected"
4. WHEN checking CDN cache THEN the system SHALL inspect Age, X-Cache, x-cache-hits, and cf-cache-status headers
5. IF Age > 0 or cache-status indicates hit THEN the system SHALL mark as cached and show TTL if available
6. THE system SHALL support detection for Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, and AWS CloudFront

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to check if the LCP element is server-side rendered, so that I can optimize critical rendering path performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing LCP elements THEN the system SHALL parse the HTML response to identify candidate LCP elements (img, video, background-image)
2. IF the LCP element is present in initial HTML THEN the system SHALL mark as "Server-side rendered"
3. IF the LCP element is absent from initial HTML and injected later THEN the system SHALL mark as "Client-side only"
4. THE analysis SHALL only apply to initial full page loads, not SPA transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to identify script optimization opportunities, so that I can reduce blocking resources and improve page load times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing scripts THEN the system SHALL detect duplicate script src includes in HEAD and return an array of duplicate values
2. WHEN checking defer scripts THEN the system SHALL list all external script src defer tags in HEAD
3. WHEN checking async scripts THEN the system SHALL list all external script src async tags in HEAD
4. THE system SHALL only analyze external scripts and ignore inline JavaScript
5. THE system SHALL recommend further delaying of defer scripts where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to identify link tag issues and optimization opportunities, so that I can improve resource loading efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing link tags THEN the system SHALL detect preload, dns-prefetch, and preconnect links incorrectly placed in BODY
2. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL detect duplicate preload links and return an array of duplicate href values
3. WHEN validating preloads THEN the system SHALL detect preload links with invalid rel values
4. WHEN checking redundancy THEN the system SHALL detect preload links for scripts already marked with defer/async
5. IF the LCP element is an image in HTML THEN the system SHALL check if corresponding preload exists in HEAD
6. THE system SHALL return arrays of offending href values for each check type

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to analyze CSS loading patterns, so that I can optimize stylesheet delivery and reduce render-blocking resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing static CSS analysis THEN the system SHALL list all link rel='stylesheet' tags in HEAD
2. WHEN checking CSS placement THEN the system SHALL flag any CSS files loaded outside HEAD
3. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL flag duplicate stylesheet includes
4. THE system SHALL return an array of stylesheet href values with position and duplicate flags
5. THE system SHALL prepare for future dynamic unused CSS analysis using Chrome DevTools Coverage API

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the analysis process, so that I understand the current state and can act accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is still loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading state on the recommendations button
2. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL enable the copy to clipboard functionality
4. THE system SHALL use status indicators: ✅ for good, ⚠️ for potential improvement, ❌ for problems detected

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want recommendations in JSON format, so that I can programmatically process and integrate the data into my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL structure results by category (Cache, LCP, Scripts, Links, CSS)
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use expandable sections with arrays and flags clearly displayed
3. WHEN copying to clipboard THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted JSON
4. THE JSON format SHALL include all analysis results with clear categorization and actionable data
