# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Chrome Extension to provide comprehensive Core Web Vitals (CWV) assessment for any webpage. The extension will capture, display, and export real-time performance metrics with support for modern web applications including SPAs. The goal is to create a developer-friendly tool that provides accurate, up-to-date performance insights with an intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Metrics Collection and Display

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to view essential Core Web Vitals metrics for any webpage, so that I can quickly assess the performance characteristics of the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS, DOM Load Time, and Navigation Time metrics
2. WHEN metrics are being collected THEN the system SHALL show accurate values with appropriate units (ms for time-based metrics, score for CLS)
3. WHEN metrics are unavailable or still loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate placeholder text or loading indicators
4. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL use color indicators (green/orange/red) based on Google's Core Web Vitals thresholds

### Requirement 2: Loading State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators while metrics are being measured, so that I understand the extension is actively working and don't see outdated information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is measuring performance THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator (spinner or "Measuring performance..." text)
2. WHEN navigating to a new page THEN the system SHALL clear previous metrics and show loading state
3. WHEN metrics collection is complete THEN the system SHALL hide loading indicators and display current metrics
4. WHEN previous page metrics exist THEN the system SHALL NOT display stale data from the previous navigation

### Requirement 3: Single Page Application Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with modern web frameworks, I want the extension to accurately measure performance in SPAs, so that I can assess performance during virtual navigation events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a virtual navigation occurs in an SPA THEN the system SHALL detect the navigation event
2. WHEN SPA navigation is detected THEN the system SHALL recalculate LCP and Navigation Time for the new view
3. WHEN working with Angular, React, Next.js, or Vue applications THEN the system SHALL correctly handle framework-specific navigation patterns
4. WHEN multiple navigation events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without displaying incorrect metrics

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Content Handling

**User Story:** As a user analyzing websites with dynamic content, I want metrics to update automatically as the page changes, so that I can see how performance evolves over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page content changes dynamically THEN the system SHALL auto-refresh relevant metrics continuously
2. WHEN new content loads (ads, lazy-loaded images, infinite scroll) THEN the system SHALL update LCP and CLS accordingly
3. WHEN CLS shifts occur THEN the system SHALL reflect the updated cumulative score
4. WHEN metrics update THEN the system SHALL briefly highlight changed values to indicate updates
5. WHEN metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL display a "Last updated" timestamp

### Requirement 5: Metrics Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer or analyst, I want to export collected metrics as JSON, so that I can integrate the data into reports or further analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Copy as JSON" THEN the system SHALL copy all current metrics as a structured JSON object to the clipboard
2. WHEN metrics are copied THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message (e.g., "Metrics copied!")
3. WHEN no metrics are available THEN the system SHALL disable the copy button or show an appropriate message
4. WHEN copying metrics THEN the JSON SHALL include metric names, values, units, and timestamp

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the extension interface to be accessible and easy to use, so that I can effectively use the tool regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain a compact size (approximately 300px wide)
2. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL use a clean list/table format with clear labels, values, and units
3. WHEN the interface is accessed via screen reader THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and support
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support standard keyboard interactions
5. WHEN color indicators are used THEN the system SHALL also provide non-color-based indicators for accessibility

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work reliably without impacting the performance of the websites I visit, so that I can trust the metrics and not affect the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL NOT significantly impact the host page's performance
2. WHEN collecting metrics THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking functionality
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the extension encounters unsupported pages THEN the system SHALL show informative messages about limitations
